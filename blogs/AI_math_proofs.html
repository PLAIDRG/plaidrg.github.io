            <p>
                It’s common knowledge that people are nervous about AI taking or replacing their jobs. Many academics, including some of my professors, have expressed similar concerns. This article isn’t here to discuss the general limitations of AI, but rather to discuss a specific application of AI in the context of math: the effects of AI doing math proofs.
            </p>

            <h3>AI Doing Math</h3>
            <p>
                Recently coding languages have been developed that allow us to code mathematical theorems and proofs. The coding languages check for mathematical correctness and throw an error if we make a mistake. This allows us to guarantee mathematical consistency as we go through a series of proofs. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same holds for AI. We can have AI develop mathematical proofs in this language. Then we may choose to throw out all invalid proofs, thus giving us AI that can’t hallucinate ‘inconsistent math’ (math with contradictions). This gives us a motif for automatically proving mathematics with AI.
            </p>

            <h3>The Role of a Mathematician</h3>
            <p>
                I would not fault someone for saying the mathematician’s job is to prove theorems. I would argue this is wrong though. Let’s take inspiration from the Ancient Greek etymology of mathematics: <em>μαθηματικά</em>, meaning “things pertaining to learning or study”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice the end-goal of mathematics wasn’t to prove a theorem, but to rewrite one's perspective and understanding! This is what I claim the spirit of mathematics is: <strong>engineering one’s mind toward a perspective of the world that recognizes underlying structures for what they have to be.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>How AI Will Change the Math Landscape</h3>
            <p>
                With this in mind, does AI threaten the mathematician? Even though AI can solve mathematical theorems, it’s typically terrible at explaining them. Additionally, a solved theorem is not an understood theorem. The job of mathematicians is to communicate ideas and make ideas cogent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                AI will give us quicker access to solving theorems, allowing us to direct our efforts effectively. If we know a theorem is true, we now want to understand <em>why</em> and where this will lead us next. Thus, we can think of automated theorem proving as an oracle that directs us toward our next goal of understanding.

            <h3>About James Squires</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a third year math and physics double major at UGA who does a wide array of research in machine learning, optimization, categorical quantum computing, and recently, categorical AI. I particularly love type theory and category theory.
