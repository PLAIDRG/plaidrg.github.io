                I’m sure everyone occasionally has flashbacks to high school geometry–I do myself! I really didn’t like school at the time and I mostly zoned out during class. However, when I actually did the math problems, there was a certain satisfaction that I received. When we were given in-class problems, I had to compensate for my lack of scholarly attitude by maximizing the utility I gained from the knowledge I did retain; I would typically try deriving any angle identity we were given from my understanding of right angles and parallel lines. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In hindsight, I can say that my experience of having been a bad student was good for my education–this was likely my first exposure to the practice that mathematicians do; not computation, but compressing your knowledge into a few facts that can derive many things. To quote the philosopher Helvétius, <em>“The knowledge of certain principles easily compensates the lack of knowledge of certain facts.”</em> This is the practice, virtue, and strength of mathematics.

            <h3>The Birth of Mathematics</h3>
            <p>
                Geometry was one of the first mathematics developed. The etymology means “measurement of earth”. Unsurprisingly, the first applications were largely for measuring land plots for such things as ownership. But around 300 B.C.E., something truly incredible happened. Euclid wrote his book <em>Elements</em>. Euclid, a Greek mathematician, developed what we call an axiomatic formulation for mathematics.

            <p>
                He compiled many previously known results, and organized them into a cogent masterpiece where from five seemingly obvious statements, we can derive many of the iconic geometry theorems we know and love. Doing so streamlines mathematical progression by establishing not only a common language, but a common set of facts with which we can build on.
            </p>

            <h3>Analytic and Synthetic Geometry</h3>
            <p>
                Analytic geometry has its obvious merits. In the real world, we measure things! You can’t do physics without measuring different physical quantities such as length, mass, time, or velocity. When Newton developed calculus to describe classical mechanics, he developed an analytic discipline. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, we can still opine the decline of synthetic geometry, the beautiful pearl of mathematics. Diagrammatic reasoning with ruler-and-compass is an amazing heuristic for solving mathematical problems. It’s not difficult to claim that, to an extent, the geometric intuition previously held by almost all mathematicians has atrophied into a select skill. But something weird is happening.

            <h3>Automatic Theorem Proving, AI, and Geometry</h3>
            <p>
                Coding languages for mathematics have developed in the past two decades into a booming field of study. These languages allow us to do mathematical proofs in a computer in such a way that if an error is made, the computer detects said error. So what happens if we do this with the mathematical proofs we ask LLMs to produce? We can have proofs of theorems generated almost instantly and checked for correctness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, what mathematical branch of study has been thoroughly explored, is logically organized in a way that we can code it into a computer, and basically forms a playbox for AI to explore mathematical proofs in? <strong>Synthetic geometry!</strong> Recent consolidated efforts have seen the development of benchmarks and models for Automated Theorem Proving of geometry, and they are growing better each year. It’s not an overstatement to say this is likely an underground revolution for mathematics.
