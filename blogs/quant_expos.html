            <h2>Palatable Knowledge is a Seed Without a Forest: A Case Against General Audience Exposition of Quantum Mechanics</h2>

                Quantum mechanics; to the average person it’s spooky and weird and counterintuitive… to the physicist it’s spooky and weird and counterintuitive… and to the mathematician it’s math.
            </p>

            <p>
                My intent by writing this article is to not disparage avid autodidacts, rather, it’s to set realistic boundaries that are often shunted by popular narratives of scientific exposition. You may have heard that you only really understand something if you can teach it to a five year old; I won’t assert whether this claim is right or not, but I will assert that, in the case of quantum mechanics, this five year old better be damn smart.

            <h3>The Inherent Tradeoff</h3>
            <p>
                In my experience writing for various levels—from high school expositions to high-level research—I’ve discovered an inherent tradeoff between <strong>accuracy, specificity, and understandability</strong>. As we make something more intuitive, we iron out the "quarks" of the subject, leading to a deceiving and partial picture at best.
            </p>

            <h3>Four Layers of Understanding</h3>
            <p>I categorize understanding into four distinct stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Novice:</strong> Exposure to basic concepts and simplified equations (High School/Intro College).</li>
                <li><strong>Apprentice:</strong> Introduction to the theory and motivation; comfortable with manipulation (Undergraduate).</li>
                <li><strong>Practitioner:</strong> Reproducing results and deep-diving into topics with established intuition (Early Graduate).</li>
                <li><strong>Pioneer:</strong> Working on the liminal boundaries and leading research (PhD/Professional).</li>
            </ul>

            

            <p>
                For something like classical mechanics, there is an intuition that accompanies the material. But for quantum mechanics, there is no such intuition because we don’t interact with the microscopic world. The first exposure a student has to quantum mechanics is through the abstraction of <strong>linear algebra and differential equations</strong>. What hope is there to explain these things to someone who hasn't taken those courses?
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Even though math models physics, in the case of quantum mechanics, we want to think of physics through the math."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The "Fast-Food" Information Problem</h3>
            <p>
                General audience information conveyed on platforms like YouTube or TikTok is often "fast-food" information. It doesn’t enrich your perspective; rather, it’s a morsel of knowledge processed to be easily palatable. But ideas are understood not in isolation, but through their deep interconnection.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we plant a lone tree, it will wither and die. But if we plant a forest, it will grow and thrive. The understanding of quantum mechanics can only flourish as an enriched network of ideas that take years of mastery. To quote Aristotle, <em>"The Whole is greater than the Part."</em>

            <h3>About James Squires</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a third year math and physics double major at UGA who does a wide array of research in machine learning, optimization, categorical quantum computing, and recently, categorical AI. I particularly love type theory and category theory.
