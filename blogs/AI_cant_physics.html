            <h2>Why AI Cannot Do Physics: a Counterclaim to the Generalizability of LLM Models to Physics Oriented Research</h2>

                I’ve previously discussed why AI can do many parts of what is traditionally thought of as a mathematician’s task quite effectively. However, I retained a distinction between the delegations of a physicist and a mathematician. The mathematician works with mathematical objects; in other words, they work in a closed, well defined system. This is inherently programmable. However, based on our current abilities, the same cannot be claimed for the role of a physicist.
            </p>

            <p>
                When asked at a meeting to describe what physicists do, I said <strong>“Physicists observe physical phenomena and specify these into physical or mathematical models.”</strong> In other words, we’re translating senses and measurements observed in ‘reality’, whatever that may be, into a mathematical representation. We then analyze what this mathematical representation is capable of doing and where it breaks; this is called theoretical physics.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                The philosopher stone of physics is to obtain a mathematical representation that entirely matches physical reality.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                With this in mind, it seems quite obvious that the LLM is incapable of performing the role of a physicist: modeling physical reality. Unlike the mathematician, who works within a system, the physicist must specify one system to another. An LLM can easily work within a mathematical representation; however, an LLM has limited physics reasoning capacity because it lacks the anchoring of physical perception.

            <h3>The Abstraction Ladder and Piaget</h3>

            <p>
                To understand this, we should look at Piaget’s psychology of child development. Human intelligence is built on a foundation that LLMs simply do not possess:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensorimotor Stage:</strong> Learning how to physically interact with objects and coordinate senses.</li>
                <li><strong>Preoperational Stage:</strong> Acquiring basic abstractions of perceptions (associating the word 'tree' with a physical tree).</li>
                <li><strong>Concrete Operational Stage:</strong> Learning rules, manipulating symbols, and developing induction skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Formal Operational Stage:</strong> Generating hypotheses and implementing fully abstract reasoning.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Notice that the fundamental foundation for abstraction is sensory perception. We can trace each abstraction or ‘token’ back to some physical perception. LLMs, however, have <em>abstraction without the anchoring of physical perception</em>. Modeling is the iterative process that carries physical perception to abstraction. This, at the present moment, is uniquely human.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although we can partially semantically ground AI in physical reality by building pipelines of physical perception (such as CNNs for image processing), the interplay between perception and abstraction is likely far more challenging to implement than the abstraction bit. To invent an AI model capable of performing physical measurement, we essentially need to reinvent the human itself.

            <p>
                I'm a third year math and physics double major at UGA who does a wide array of research in machine learning, optimization, categorical quantum computing, and recently, categorical AI. I particularly love type theory and category theory.
