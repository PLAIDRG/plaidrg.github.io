               When I first learned the notion of untyped lambda calculus, it was trial by fire. I was reading a book on constructivism and it randomly emerged in some derivations.
              At the time I was a bit baffled and it would be that way for the rest of the semester. In hindsight, I have to say that untyped lambda calculus is relatively simple at it's foundations.
              There are only two concepts: application and abstraction. From your variables and your inductively built lambda terms, you produce your universe of objects to work with. And then we only have a few relations
              such as alpha equivalence, beta reduction, and the other random 'insert Greek letter' equivalences that I don't remember. The syntax can be intimidating at first, but I assure those who are new to logic that this is a beautiful topic,
              not only for what it gives us, but for its simplicity (although it should be acknowledged that research can still become quite involved here; especially when we talk about categories). The February 2026 reading should have what I think is
              the best/easiest introduction for those unfamiliar with logic in general.

            <p>
                I'm a third year math and physics double major at UGA who does a wide array of research in machine learning, optimization, categorical quantum computing, and recently, categorical AI. I particularly love type theory and category theory.
