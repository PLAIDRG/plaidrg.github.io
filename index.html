        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We are the Physics, Logic, and AI Directed Reading Group (PLAIDRG) at UGA. 
            Our aim is to provide an ecosystem for studying these topics at UGA collaboratively.
            We investigate topics such as mechanistic interpretability, ad-hoc interpretability, formalization (especially via ITPs like Lean), type theory,
            compositionality, mathematical frameworks for AI, and more. We meet once a month to discuss papers from the reading 
            list in a group seminar format.
